## Project 1: Number Guessing Game
A C++ game where users try to guess a randomly generated number. The game saves the highest score to a file, allowing players to track their progress over time.

**Key Features:**
- Random number generation
- High score tracking
- File handling for persistent storage

## Project 2: Simple Calculator
A basic calculator implemented in C++, capable of performing standard arithmetic operations. The application stores calculation history in a file and allows users to delete the history as needed.

**Key Features:**
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- History tracking with file storage
- Data validation for accurate calculations

## Project 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in C++ where players can choose their character (X or O) and play against each other. The game includes full input validation to ensure a fair and enjoyable experience.

**Key Features:**
- Player character selection
- Game logic implementation
- Input validation for error-free gameplay

## Project 4: To-Do List Application
A to-do list manager written in C++, allowing users to create, complete, delete, and add tasks. All tasks are saved to a file to ensure data persistence across sessions.

**Key Features:**
- Task management (create, complete, delete, add)
- File handling for task storage
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface

## Project 5: Library Management System
A comprehensive library management system developed in C++ with SQLite 3. The system supports adding, editing, and removing books, as well as searching by ISBN, author, or title. It also includes a checkout and return feature with due date management and overdue checks.

**Key Features:**
- Book management (add, edit, remove)
- Search functionality by ISBN, author, or title
- Checkout and return system with due date tracking
- SQLite 3 integration for database management

## Installation and Usage
To run any of these projects on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akram777077/CODSOFT
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project-directory
   ```
3. Compile the C++ files:
   ```bash
   g++ -o projectName main.cpp
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./projectName
   ```

**Note:** Ensure you have a C++ compiler and SQLite 3 installed on your system for the Library Management System.
